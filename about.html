      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>We are a group of students who, like many people, 
        felt some sort of mental decline after coming out of a period of isolation. 
        We believe that many others had a similar experience and could benefit from 
        some form of therapy. Therapy is a very broad term and can encompass many things, 
        as a group we focused on the idea of personal growth through journaling.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to empower individuals to overcome the challenges of mental decline 
        following periods of isolation by fostering personal growth and resilience through 
        the transformative power of journaling. We are dedicated to creating a supportive 
        community of students and individuals alike who have experienced similar struggles, 
        and providing them with the tools, resources, and guidance needed to navigate their
        unique paths to self-discovery, healing, and well-being. By championing the practice
         of journaling as a versatile and accessible form of therapy, we aspire to make a 
         lasting impact on the lives of those we serve and contribute to a happier, healthier, 
         and more connected world.</p>
      <p>Thank you for using our website, and we hope it serves as a catalyst for your journey 
        towards self-awareness, healing, and personal growth as you navigate the challenges of 
        reintegration and beyond.</p>
