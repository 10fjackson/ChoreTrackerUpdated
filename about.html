Our Process:
Ideation and Conceptualization:
Our journey began with brainstorming sessions where we identified challenges faced by individuals like us everyday. We aimed to create a user-friendly platform that would create a small (but meaningful) difference in peopleâ€™s lives.
 
User Research:
To ensure our platform would meet the needs and expectations of our users and idea, we conducted extensive research on HTML, CSS, and, most importantly, Javascript.
 
Design and Development:
Armed with our research findings, we moved on to the design and development phase. Suparna, with a keen eye for aesthetics and user experience, took the lead in crafting an intuitive and visually appealing interface. Finley, our coding expert, leveraged his technical skills to bring the design to life. Hayden, our tester, ensured that every feature worked seamlessly, and made sure that the group was adhering to agile processes throughout the project.
 
Agile Development:
We adopted an agile development approach, breaking down the project into manageable tasks and iterations. This allowed us to deliver incremental updates and gather valuable feedback as we worked on the project helping us to refine and enhance the website's performance and utility.
 
Security and Privacy:
We understand the importance of data security and privacy in today's digital world. Therefore, we guarantee no data is tracked or saved using our website.
 
Summary:
Our website is the result of a collaborative effort between Finley Jackson, Suparna Pal, and Hayden Kaufmann. We leveraged our expertise in design, development, and testing to create a platform that helps users manage their daily tasks and stay organized. We are proud of what we have accomplished, and we hope that you find our website useful and enjoyable to use.
