                            Assigning chores in a fair, unbiased way is a difficult task, especially if it's being done
                            between complete adolescent strangers. With classes already taking up most of our time, no one
                            wants to come home to a messy place and have to nag their roommates to do their chores. Our
                            inspiration for this was the fact that we are all students and are most likely living with roommates.
                            Our idea is to create a website that allows users to input various information to create a calendar
                            that they can save and print out and put up on their fridge or just keep as a reminder of when it's
                            their turn to do a chore. Each chore will rotate through the roommates so everyone is doing the same
                            amount of chores.
